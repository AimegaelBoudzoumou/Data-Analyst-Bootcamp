# Building a BMI Calculator with Python

```python
name = input("Enter your name")

weight = int(input("Enter your weight in pounds"))

height = int(input("Enter your height in inch"))

BMI =  (weight * 703) / (height * height)

print("Your BMI is", BMI)

if BMI > 0:
    if (BMI<18.5):
        print(name + ", you are underwight.")
    elif (BMI<24.9):
        print(name + ", you are normal weight.")
    elif (BMI<29.9):
        print(name + ", you are overweight.")
    elif (BMI<34.9):
        print(name + ", you are obese.")
    elif (BMI<39.9):
        print(name + ", you are severely obese.")
    else:
        print(name + ", you are morbidly obese.")
else:
    print("Please enter a valid number")
